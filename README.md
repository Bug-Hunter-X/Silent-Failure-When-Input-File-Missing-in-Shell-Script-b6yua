This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in shell scripting: silent failure when an input file is missing.  The script `bug.sh` attempts to process a file, but doesn't include error handling for the case where the file doesn't exist.  The solution, in `bugSolution.sh`, demonstrates how to properly check for the file's existence before attempting to process it.  This prevents silent failures and provides informative error messages to the user.
